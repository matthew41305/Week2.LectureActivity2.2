/* undertand else-if-if/else for/while/do-while loops, switch statements, and documenting code
conditional code allows us to control the flow of programs, still executes from top to bottom but we can create/add structures
switch statements can pretty much be used interchangeably. For/do/while loops will keep looping until set condition is met.
Ex (assume that myGrade has a value of 100): If (myGrade) >= 90 {
console.log("I got an A!!");
}
else if (myGrade < 90 && myGrade > 70) {
console.log ("not bad, i need to try more");
}else
console.log ("Oops. I need to try even more");
}

// looping statements the main loops options would include

/* for loops - counter, condition, and what happens in between loops
while-loops - different syntax, start with while with a condition, if it meets the condition it will execute and move to an assignement value ex: let i=1 while (i<= 10) {
console.log(i) // prints 1,2,3 ... , 10
i++;
}
do-while - different syntax, starts with do first, the while followed by the condition , garaunteed to run at least once because it starts with the do then the condition. then the rest 
would pretty much be the same let i=1;
do {
console.log(i); // prints 1,2,3, ... 100
i++;
}while (i <= 10); // adds one to i over and over for loop
}

be wary with do while as it will always execute at least one first, then check the condition so make sure you apply it properly

SWITCH STATEMENTS are similar to if/else-if/else, they can be used more intuitively sometimes
used with case statements, ensure to use breaks or else it will keep executing more than what is necessary "bleed through"

GOOD code doesn't need an necessary amount of comments

i++ is shorthand to had one to value of i, in the same way i-- will subtract one from the value of i
